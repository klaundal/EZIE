These are tools that are used by the main scripts below:
--------------------------------------------------------
sh.py                       - some tools for spherical harmonic analysis (used in the Fig 1 script)
simulation_utils.py         - some tools for reading and interpolating the MHD output


This is a preprocessing script that must be run before two of the main scripts below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
samdata_to_pandas.py        - converts relevant parts of Sam's IDL file to pandas


These scripts make figures for the paper (and do the relevant calculations):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
height_dependence_figure.py - makes Fig 1 that shows heigh dependence of magnetic fields of different scale sizes
inversion_example_figure.py - performs inversion and makes figure that compares MHD output to SECS representation
data_geometry_figure.py     - plots the cubedsphere grid, measurement tracks, and measurements



------------------------------------------------
In addition to standard stuff, the code requires 
- secsy https://github.com/klaundal/secsy 
- dipole https://github.com/klaundal/dipole
