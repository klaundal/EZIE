Suggested EGU abstract: \newline
The auroral electrojet is traditionally measured remotely with magnetometers on ground or in low Earth orbit. The long distance, more than 100 km, means that smaller scale sizes are not detected. Because of this, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the electrojet are not known. Recent advances in measurement technology give hope of remote detections of the magnetic field in the mesosphere, very close to the electrojet. We present a prediction of the magnitude of these disturbances, inferred from the spatiotemporal characteristics of magnetic field-aligned currents. We also discuss how a constellation of small satellites carrying the Microwave Electrojet Magnetogram (MEM) instrument \cite{yee20}, could be used to essentially image the equivalent current at unprecedented spatial resolution.

\section{Introduction}
Electrojet traditionally measured from ground + later satellites. Disadvantage: Distance $>$ 100~km, which removes fine scale structures. $\Rightarrow$ electrojet spatial structure is not known

New techniques available (EZIE \cite{Yee20}+ maybe sodium laser measurements \cite{Kane18} ), which offer the potential to distinguish between different fine-scale structures in the electrojet. 

\subsection{Prediction of mesospheric magnetic field disturbance magnitudes}
Since the mesosphere is resistive and presumably free of electric current, it is expected that magnetic field disturbances there are sensitive to the same part of the ionospheric electric current system as is observed from ground. In polar regions, where the main magnetic field is nearly vertical, this is primarily the divergence-free part of the horizontal ionospheric current \cite{Fukushima76,Untiedt93,Laundal15}, since the contributions from field-aligned currents and their curl-free horizontal closure currents cancel. 

The current associated with magnetic field perturbations below the ionosphere are often modeled as a so-called equivalent current \cite{Kamide81}, an electric sheet current density on a spherical shell at some fixed altitude, which can account for the observed magnetic field. In this paper, we use the term electrojet synonymously with the equivalent current. The variation in magnetic field strength as function of distance from the electrojet depends on scale size; large-scale currents are seen at greater distances than small-scale currents. Mesospheric magnetic field measurements will therefore enable us to resolve smaller spatial scales than ground measurements. The purpose of this section is to quantify the height variation of the magnetic field disturbances, based on what we already know about the spatial structure of ionospheric currents. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/radial_dependence.pdf}
\caption{B) Altitude variation of $\Delta B$, assuming spatial structure of electrojet is similar to field-aligned currents. Normalized to 100~nT on ground. C)Contour plots of magnetic field of a random electrojet with similar spatial structure (spatial power spectrum) as FACs, shown at 85~km and on ground. }
\label{fig:radial_dependence}
\end{figure}

The key assumption that we use is that the spatial power spectrum of the electrojet is proportional with the spatial power spectrum of the field-aligned electric currents. In contrast to the electrojet power spectrum, empirical estimates of the FAC spatial power spectrum are available. Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}A shows the spatial power spectrum of the magnetic field associated with FACs, in bold black, from \cite{Gjerloev11}, who used satellite magnetometers on the three ST-5 satellites, which flew in a pearl-on-a-string configuration in polar low Earth orbit. Since this orbit intersects the FACs, the determination of small spatial scales is not restricted by distance, as for the electrojet. This particular spatial power spectrum is valid for nightside during disturbed conditions (AL index $<-100$~nT). The spectrum is close to linear on a log-log scale, and we use this property to extrapolate to scale sizes which are longer than those considered by \cite{Gjerloev11}. The fitted and extrapolated curve is shown in gray. 

The curves in Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}A, which represents the average magnitude of FAC magnetic field disturbances as function of scale size, is now assumed to also describe the spatial scale of the electrojet at zero distance from the current sheet. With this assumption, we can derive the radial variation of the magnetic field using results from spherical harmonic analysis. Equation 118 of \cite{Sabaka10} describes the squared magnetic field, averaged over a sphere at radius $r \le R$, where $R$ is the current sheet radius, as follows
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{B}(r)^2\rangle = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^{2n-2}\sum_{m=0}^{n}[(q_n^m)^2 + (s_n^m)^2] = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^{2n-2}A_n. \label{eq:spectrum}
\end{equation}
$n$ and $m$ are spherical harmonic degree and order, respectively; $a=6371.2$~km is a reference radius; and $q_n^m$ and $s_n^m$ are spherical harmonic coefficients. On the right hand side, the sum over spherical harmonic order $m$ is written as $A_n$. The terms in the sum represent the extent to which each degree $n$ contributes to the squared magnitude of the magnetic field. 

We assume that the curves in Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}A represent the square root of this quantity, at $r=R$. The scale size $L$ and spherical harmonic degree $n$ are related by $\pi R_{FAC}/L$, where $R_{FAC}$ is the radius at which the power spectrum of Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}A was evaluated by \cite{Gjerloev11}. They mapped their measurements to 200~km altitude. This allows us to solve for $A_n$, and thus calculate the squared magnetic field magnitude, averaged over the sphere, as function of radius $r$ using equation (\ref{eq:spectrum}). The square root of this is shown in Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}B. The thick black line is based only on the part of the spatial power spectrum that \cite{Gjerloev11} measured, and the grey line is based on an extrapolation to include scale sizes up to spherical harmonic degree $n=10$. It is clear that when larger scale sizes are included, the radial variation is less dramatic. The current sheet layer was placed at 105~km. Both curves are normalized such that the magnetic field perturbation on ground is 100~nT. The two curves show about $50\%$ and $90\%$ increases from ground to 85~km. 

Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}C shows contour plots of the magnetic field magnitude at 0~km and at 85~km, for an equivalent current whose magnetic field has the same power spectrum as used with the grey line in Figure \ref{fig:radial_dependence}B. This is done by assigning random spherical harmonic coefficients $q_n^0$ and $s_n^0$ which obey $(q_n^0)^2 + (s_n^0)^2 = A_n$. Longitudinal variations ($m>0$) are ignored. The figure is not meant to show a realistic magnetic field, but rather to visualize the difference in spatial structure in the magnetic field disturbances at ground and in the mesosphere. 







\section{Resolving electrojet using mesospheric magnetic field measurements}
Point: Demonstrate / quantify increased capability in determining electrojet structure with meospheric measurements compared to ground



Subsections:
\begin{enumerate}
\item EZIE mission concept
\item MHD simulation details
\item Electrojet inversion
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{figures/paper_outline.pdf}
\caption{PRELIMINARY FIGURE: Schematic to illustrate what is done in this paper: Calculate equivalent current based on realistic measurements from EZIE, and compare the result to 1) equivalent current calculated from an ideal distribution of perfect measurements of $\Delta \pmb B$ at 85~km, and 2) the divergence-free part of the horizontal ionospheric currents.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{EZIE mission concept}
Description of mission: Grid, time resolution, precision (basically going from spectrum to B + error)

Limitations of look direction

\subsection{Test simulation}
Description and plots of MHD simulation and snapshot(s) that we will use. \vskip1ex

Description of the simulated data: How is the (perfect) MHD output used to produce measurements on grid with noise / uncertainty etc. Much of this is covered in \cite{yee20}\vskip1ex

Description of ideal figures ($\pmb J_{eq}^{ideal}$ and $\pmb J^{df}_{H}$): $\pmb J_{eq}^{ideal}$ is the equivalent curent at 110 (?) km altitude calculated with perfect knowledge about the magnetic field at 85 km. This is what we would get if we had no noise, and perfect spatial coverage. $\pmb J^{df}_{H}$ is the divergence-free part of the horizontal current. $\pmb J_{eq}^{ideal}$ and $\pmb J^{df}_{H}$ are expected to be very similar, but not exactly: $\pmb J_{eq}^{ideal}$ does not have spatial structures $<$ distance to electrojet, and it has contributions from magnetospheric currents. $\pmb J^{df}_{H}$ has all spatial scales of the MHD simulation, and no contribution from magnetosphere. 


\subsection{Electrojet inversion}
Description of algorithm - this is the main section of the paper describing the details of the inversion. Rough description:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Magnetic field at 85~km on a grid - defined by satellite orbit, 4 viewing directions, and sampling frequency/integration time. Three magnetic field components with different errors every direction - and correlated errors so we can not use least squares techniques directly
\item Technique: Place divergence-free spherical elementary current systems (SECS) \cite{Amm97,vanhamaki20} on a grid (details tbd) and find the amplitudes that fit the measurements. Several MHD model snapshots should be used to find an optimal grid + regularization parameters.  
\item With known divergence-free SECS amplitudes, plot the divergence free current and compare to the ideal currents discussed above
\end{itemize}




\section{Discussion}
Summary and discussion of assumptions and implications. Below are some suggested sections about the limitations in the approach of this paper. 
\subsection{Effect of weighted volume emission  }
Can we merge/combine the inversions: Instead of spectrum $\rightarrow$ magnetic field $\rightarrow$ equivalent current, we do spectrum $\rightarrow$ equivalent current.\vskip1ex
use probabilistic inversion methods?
\subsection{Effect of uncertainties in measurement location }
There is an uncertainty in the location of the measurements (where the emission comes from). What is the corresponding uncertainty in electrojet estimate? This probably requires different inversion methods. (related to previous subsection... )
\subsection{Effect of temporal variations }
In this paper we work with snapshots of MHD model. What are the effects of time variations?
